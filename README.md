The python scripts provided in this repository mostly deals with the propagation scenario of two optical pulses inside an optical fiber, subject to coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation, through cross phase modulation. It also includes efficient algorithms for the numerical solution of coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation with global error of fourth-order. Furthermore, it also has python scripts to carry out numerical experiments for simulating soliton crosss trapping.

## Prerequisites

The scripts in the ```internship_HB2021``` repository requires a working ```Python3``` environement with the functionality of ```numpy, scipy``` and ```matplotlib```.


The repository can be clone by running the following in the command line: 

```$ git clone https://github.com/Huzzi-Aliaas/Thesis_HB2021-22.git```
